# MW2_Campaign_Mods

## How To Use
- Download iw4sp_codmod.exe and place it in your Modern Warfare 2 Root Folder
- Choose a .rar to download, extract it, and place the files in a new folder called "spdata" in the MW2 Root
  - Don't install more than 1 mod at once (will probably break)
- Launch the game via the iw4sp_codmod.exe. This exe will load the mod and give you access to the developer console (~)

## Folder setup should be
- Modern Warfare 2 root
  - iw4sp_codmod.exe
  - iw4sp.hk
  - spdata
    - (extracted rar files)
    
## Mods I Will Not Be Adding
- The Civilian Juggernaut Mods. It contains assets and fastfiles that belong to IW
    
## Editing
- Feel free to edit any of the gsc files, just don't upload them as your own without giving credit
